This project are used to generating source code from IDL files provided by W3C.

You can set NEED_GENERATE_DOM variable to turn on generating source. For generating you must
have Python, gcc-xml and OmniORB IDL Compiler on you %PATH%. Also if you have AStyle, 
generated source will by styled.

All generated sources located in 'generated_dom' directory. If you want to implement
some DOM class methods you can move corresponding files from 'generated_dom/not_implemented' 
directory to 'implemented' directory and change it. If DOM class don't have any methods
the source file for that class will not generated, but you can create source file in 
'implemented' directory to change default constructor of this class.
