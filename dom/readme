This project are used to generating source code from IDL files provided by W3C.

You can set NEED_GENERATE_DOM variable to turn on generating source. For generating you must
have Python, gcc-xml and OmniORB IDL Compiler on you %PATH%. Also if you have AStyle, 
generated source will by styled.

All generated sources located in 'generated_dom' directory. If you want to implement
some DOM class methods you can move corresponding files from 'generated_dom/not_implemented' 
directory to 'implemented' directory and change it.
